# CodersPortfolio
An study about making a Portfolio for Coders and Programmers to show their work

Coders Folio works basically in two structures. Profile and Portfolio.
# Profile
Profile holds the user basic contact info, as name, e-mail and phone number. it also contains a presentation letter, so the user can talk about himself, what he likes, what he wants and whatever he'd like. 

# Portfolio
Portfolio page contains the user #Skills and #Projects. 

Skills are a set of #Languages and #Level of Knowledge, grading from 0 (absolute beginner) to level 5 (absolute master). Aan user can have multiple skills, and show them all in his codefolio.

Projects is a component where the user can set up a showcase to show what projects he has been working on, by providing a #Name and #Description. He can also set what #Languages he used in it. A project can have multiple languages assigned to it, and a user can have multiple projects. the user can set a #link to the project too. Displaying a page, or download to redirect the user to where he can find, or see the project. A git repository or itch.io page, or anything the user can think of. 

# future objectives
The goal with Codersfolio is, in the future, provide a tool where programmers can share their work, and make it easier for them to show what they are capable of to possible employers. 
Ee aim to make it possible, some day, to embed the code in the page, and execute it in the browser, so users won't need to redirect to external tools, and people seeing the page won't need to do anything else to see the contents. 
One of our goals is to have a feature to make code visible or not (depending on user preferences), so employers can evaluate the code in the platform, to see how the candidate actually works. 

# open code
Codersfolio is an open code project. Anyone can help and contribute. And we really hope that you do.
